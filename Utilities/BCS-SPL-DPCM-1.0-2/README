OVERVIEW:

  These MATLAB programs implement the Differential Pulse-Code Modulation(DPCM) 
  for the Block Compressed Sensing - Smoothed Projected Landweber (BCS-SPL) 
  algorithm as described in paper:
  
  S. Mun and J. E. Fowler "DPCM for Quantized Block-Based Compressed Sensing
  of Images," in Proceedings of the European Signal Processing Conference, 
  Bucharest, Romania, August 2012, to appear.

  Specifically, this code reproduces the experiment results of the
  paper (Table 1), for the BCS-SPL, MH-BCS-SPL, MS-BCS-SPL, and
  algorithms. Respectively, the code for these is:

    run_experiment_bcsspl_dpcm.m
    run_experiment_mhbcsspl_dpcm.m
    run_experiment_msbcsspl_dpcm.m
  
  Parameters (subrates and quantizer bit-depths) used to generate the
  rate-distortion curves are stored in the Parameters directory.

  This code relies on BCS-SPL Version 1.5, MH-BCS-SPL Version 1.0, and 
  MS-BCS-SPL Version 1.2 (http://www.ece.msstate.edu/~fowler/BCSSPL/), 
  the Wavelet Software package (http://eeweb.poly.edu/iselesni/WaveletSoftware/),
  Pascal Getreuer's waveletcdf97.m (http://www.getreuer.info/home/waveletcdf97),
  and the ssim.m function (https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~z70wang/research/ssim/).

  Note that, since most of this code relies on random projections,
  the results produced may differ slightly in appearance and
  value from those of the paper.
